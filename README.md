# Side-quests
This repository contains a series of short, hands-on side Quests which I completed to explore cybersecurity and cloud computing . Each Side Quest represents a small but practical experience, focusing on learning by doing

## Side Quest 1: VirusTotal Malware Analysis  
- Logged into VirusTotal, an online malware analysis tool.  
- Performed detailed analysis of a malicious URL.  
- Investigated 2 malicious file hashes.  
- Analyzed 1 malicious IP address and 1 malicious domain name.

## Side Quest 2 – Bitwarden Vault Setup
- Created a Bitwarden account and set up a secure master vault.  
- Added credentials for 14+ personal accounts (cloud, email, OS logins, apps).  
- Improved password hygiene by centralizing storage in an encrypted manager.

## Side Quest 3 – Cryptomator File Encryption
- Installed Cryptomator and created a secure virtual drive.  
- Moved important files into the encrypted vault.  
- Set up a strong password to lock/unlock access.  
- Verified that files are only accessible when the vault is unlocked.

## Side Quest 4 – AWS Zero-Spend Budget
- Used AWS Budgets to set up a *Zero-Spend Budget*.  
- Chose the "use a template → zero spend budget" option.  
- Configured notifications to alert via email if spending > $0.01.  
- Helps track cloud usage and avoid unexpected charges.

## Side Quest 5 – Launch & Terminate EC2 Instance
- Launched an EC2 instance using *Amazon Linux 2023 (t3.micro, gp3 storage)*.  
- Connected successfully via SSH with a downloaded `.pem` key pair.  
- Explored the instance basics and verified connectivity.  
- Terminated the instance and confirmed cleanup to avoid charges.  

## Side Quest 6 – Amazon Bedrock Playground
- Requested access and enabled *Amazon Nova Lite* model in Bedrock.  
- Tested the playground by prompting the model to summarize how AWS supports startups.  
- Verified no running resources left → *no extra charges*.

## Side Quest 7: AWS Lambda Web App
- Created a serverless web app using AWS Lambda with Python.
- Connected Lambda to API Gateway to create an HTTP endpoint.
- Used AWS blueprint and basic configuration without editing code.
- Successfully deployed and tested the function for the AWS credit activity.

## Side Quest 8: Amazon RDS Database  
- Created a MySQL database instance using AWS RDS (free tier).  
- Configured master username and password securely.  
- Explored endpoint connection details.  
- Deleted the instance safely to avoid ongoing charges.
