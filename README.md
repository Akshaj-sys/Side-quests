# Side-quests

This repository contains a series of short, hands-on side Quests, which I completed to explore cybersecurity and cloud computing . Each Side Quest represents a small but practical experience, focusing on learning by doing

### Side Quest 1: VirusTotal Malware Analysis

- Logged into VirusTotal, an online malware analysis tool.
- Performed detailed analysis of a malicious URL.
- Investigated 2 malicious file hashes.
- Analyzed 1 malicious IP address and 1 malicious domain name.

### Side Quest 2 – Bitwarden Vault Setup

- Created a Bitwarden account and set up a secure master vault.
- Added credentials for 14+ personal accounts (cloud, email, OS logins, apps).
- Improved password hygiene by centralizing storage in an encrypted manager.

### Side Quest 3 – Cryptomator File Encryption

- Installed Cryptomator and created a secure virtual drive on File Explorer.
- Moved important files into the encrypted vault.
- Set up a strong password to lock/unlock access.
- Verified that files are only accessible when the vault is unlocked.

### Side Quest 4 – AWS Zero-Spend Budget

- Used AWS Budgets to set up a Zero-Spend Budget.
- Chose the "use a template” and zero spend budget" option.
- Configured notifications to alert via email if spending exceeds $0.01.
- Helped me track cloud usage and avoid unexpected charges.

### Side Quest 5 – Launch & Terminate EC2 Instance

- Launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2023 (t3.micro, gp3 storage).
- Connected via SSH with a downloaded .pem key pair.
- Explored the instance basics and verified connectivity.
- Terminated the instance and confirmed the cleanup to avoid charges.

### Side Quest 6 – Amazon Bedrock Playground

- Requested access and enabled the Amazon Nova Lite model in Bedrock.
- Tested the playground by prompting the model to summarize how AWS supports startups.
- Verified that no running resources are left → no extra charges.

### Side Quest 7: AWS Lambda Web App

- Created a serverless web app using AWS Lambda.
- Connected Lambda to an API Gateway to create an HTTP endpoint.
- Used AWS blueprint and basic configuration without editing the code.
- Successfully deployed and tested the function for AWS credit activity.

### Side Quest 8: Amazon RDS Database

- Created a MySQL database instance using AWS RDS (free tier).
- Configured master username and password securely.
- Explored endpoint connection details.
- Deleted the instance safely to avoid ongoing charges.
